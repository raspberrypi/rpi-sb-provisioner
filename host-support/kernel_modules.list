# Kernel modules required for initramfs during secure boot provisioning
#
# This file lists kernel module names (without .ko extension) that should be
# included in the initramfs. Dependencies are automatically resolved using
# modinfo, so you only need to list the top-level modules you require.
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and are ignored.
# Empty lines are ignored.
#
# To override this list, copy it to /etc/rpi-sb-provisioner/kernel_modules.list
