= Raspberry Pi 5 Connection Guide

_How to prepare Raspberry Pi 5 devices for provisioning_

== Overview

Raspberry Pi 5 has a built-in power button. Unlike Raspberry Pi 4, no GPIO configuration is required.

The connection process requires holding the power button at specific times during the procedure.

== What You Need

* One USB A to USB C cable (high quality)
* Your Raspberry Pi 5 device

== The Connection Process

Raspberry Pi 5 requires a *two-step* connection process:

=== Step 1: Initial Connection

1. *Hold down the power button* on the Raspberry Pi 5

2. *While holding the button*, plug the USB C cable from your provisioning computer into the Raspberry Pi 5

3. *Keep holding the power button* until the provisioning system recognizes the device
+
You will see this in the web interface or system logs.

4. *Release the button*

The device will start the bootstrap phase.

=== Step 2: Re-Connection

After a few moments, you need to reconnect the device:

1. *Watch the status* in the web interface (http://localhost:3142)
+
Wait until you see the status: `bootstrap-fastboot-initialisation-started`

2. *Unplug the USB C cable* from the Raspberry Pi 5

3. *Hold down the power button* on the Raspberry Pi 5

4. *While holding the button*, plug the USB C cable back into the Raspberry Pi 5

5. *Keep holding the power button* until the device is recognized again

6. *Release the button*

The device will now continue through the provisioning phases automatically.

=== When Is Provisioning Complete?

Watch the LEDs on the Raspberry Pi 5:

* *Both LEDs off* = Provisioning is complete
* You can now disconnect the device
* The device is ready to use

== Important Points To Remember

|===
|Point |Explanation

|*Two connections required*
|You must connect, disconnect, and reconnect the device during provisioning.

|*Hold button before cable*
|Always hold the power button BEFORE plugging in the cable.

|*Watch for reconnection status*
|Wait for `bootstrap-fastboot-initialisation-started` before unplugging.

|*Good cables matter*
|Use a high-quality USB A to USB C cable. Poor cables cause connection problems.

|*Monitor in web interface*
|The web interface at http://localhost:3142 shows you when to reconnect.

== Troubleshooting Raspberry Pi 5

=== Problem: Device Not Entering RPIBOOT Mode

*Symptoms:* You hold the power button and connect the cable, but nothing happens.

*Solutions:*

* *Hold button first:* Make sure you hold the power button BEFORE connecting the USB cable
* *Try a better cable:* Use a shorter, high-quality USB A to USB C cable
* *Try a different USB port:* Some USB ports work better than others
* *Check power:* Make sure your provisioning computer has enough power
* *Keep holding:* Hold the button until you see the device is recognized

=== Problem: Device Not Responding After Re-Connection

*Symptoms:* After the re-connection step, the device does not continue provisioning.

*Solutions:*

* *Check the status first:* Make sure you saw `bootstrap-fastboot-initialisation-started` before unplugging
* *Hold button during reconnect:* You must hold the power button during the re-connection too
* *Check the logs:* Look at the web interface or logs for error messages
* *Start over:* Try the complete process again from Step 1

=== Problem: Not Sure When To Reconnect

*Symptoms:* You are not sure when to unplug and reconnect the device.

*Solution:*

* *Use the web interface:* Open http://localhost:3142 and go to the Services tab
* *Watch for the status:* Wait until you see `bootstrap-fastboot-initialisation-started`
* *Then reconnect:* When you see this status, follow the reconnection steps

== Summary

*Connection process:*

1. Hold power button → Plug in cable → Release button
2. Wait for `bootstrap-fastboot-initialisation-started` status
3. Unplug cable
4. Hold power button → Plug in cable → Release button
5. Wait for both LEDs to turn off
6. Provisioning complete

*Remember:*

* Always hold button before connecting cable
* Watch web interface for reconnection timing
* Use good quality cables
* Both LEDs off = provisioning complete
