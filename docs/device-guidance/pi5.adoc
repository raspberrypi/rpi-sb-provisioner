= Raspberry Pi 5 Device Guidance

== Connecting Raspberry Pi 5 to rpi-sb-provisioner

=== Initial Connection - Entering RPIBOOT Mode

To provision a Raspberry Pi 5 device, you must force it into RPIBOOT mode:

1. **Hold the power button** on the Raspberry Pi 5 device
2. **While continuing to hold the power button**, plug the USB-C cable into the device to connect it to your provisioning machine
3. Keep holding the power button until the device is recognized by the provisioning system

=== Re-connection Procedure

After the initial connection, you will need to perform a re-connection procedure:

1. **Monitor the device state** until you see the status "bootstrap-fastboot-initialisation-started"
2. **Unplug the device** from the USB-C cable
3. **Hold the power button** on the Raspberry Pi 5 device
4. **While continuing to hold the power button**, re-plug the USB-C cable to reconnect the device
5. Keep holding the power button until the device proceeds to the next phase

=== Important Notes

* Ensure you are using a high-quality USB-A to USB-C cable as specified in the main documentation
* The power button must be held during both the initial connection and the re-connection procedure
* Do not release the power button until you confirm the device has been recognized by the provisioning system
* If the device fails to enter RPIBOOT mode, try using a different USB port on your host machine

== Troubleshooting

=== Device not entering RPIBOOT mode

If your Raspberry Pi 5 device does not enter RPIBOOT mode:

* Ensure you are holding the power button **before** connecting the USB cable
* Try a shorter, higher quality USB-A to USB-C cable
* Try a different USB port on your host machine
* Ensure the provisioning machine has sufficient power supply capability

=== Device not responding after re-connection

If the device does not proceed after the re-connection step:

* Verify that you observed the "bootstrap-fastboot-initialisation-started" state before disconnecting
* Ensure you held the power button during the re-connection
* Check the provisioning logs for any error messages
* Try the complete procedure again from the beginning
