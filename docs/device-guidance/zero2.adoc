_How to prepare Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W devices for provisioning_

== Important Limitation: No Secure Boot

[WARNING]
====
*Secure boot is NOT available on Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W devices.*

The Zero 2 W does not have the hardware needed for secure boot. You can only use:

* `fde-only` mode (encryption without secure boot)
* `naked` mode (no encryption, no secure boot)

Do NOT use `secure-boot` mode with Zero 2 W. It will not work.
====

== Connection Overview

The Zero 2 W does not have a power button or boot button. Entry into RPIBOOT mode is automatically triggered by an empty SD card.

=== Required Materials

* One USB A to microUSB B cable
* Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W device
* SD card (any size, FAT32 formatted)

=== Connection Procedure

With the empty SD card:

1. *Insert the empty SD card* into the Zero 2 W

2. *Connect the microUSB cable* from your provisioning computer to the Zero 2 W
+
Connect to the data USB port (marked "USB", not "PWR IN")

3. The Zero 2 W will automatically enter RPIBOOT mode

4. Provisioning will begin automatically

No button pressing is required.

=== Determining Completion

Monitor the device status:

* When provisioning is complete, the activity LED will be off
* The device can be disconnected
* The device is ready for deployment

== Troubleshooting Zero 2 W

=== Problem: Device Not Entering RPIBOOT Mode

*Symptoms:* You connect the device with an emtpy SD card, but it is not recognized by the provisioning system.

*Solutions:*

*1. Check the SD card is prepared correctly*

* The SD card must be formatted as FAT32
* The SD card must be completely empty

*2. Try a better USB cable*

The USB cable quality is very important for Zero 2 W devices.

* Use a shorter cable (under 1 meter is better)
* Use a high-quality cable with good data connections
* Cheap cables often only have power wires, not data wires

*3. Make sure you are using the correct USB port*

The Zero 2 W has two microUSB ports:

* *USB port (marked "USB"):* This is the data port - use this one
* *Power port (marked "PWR IN"):* This is power only - do NOT use this

Connect your cable to the "USB" port, not the "PWR IN" port.

*4. Try a different USB port on your provisioning computer*

Some USB ports work better than others:

* If you are using a USB 3 port (blue inside), try a USB 2 port (black or white inside)
* Try different ports on your provisioning computer
* Avoid using USB hubs if possible

*5. Boot the device first with Raspberry Pi OS*

Some Zero 2 W devices need to be booted once with Raspberry Pi OS before RPIBOOT mode works correctly.

This is a known issue: https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/issues/101#issuecomment-983641043

*How to do this:*

1. Get an SD card (different from your empty card)
2. Install recent Raspberry Pi OS on it (using Raspberry Pi Imager)
3. Put the SD card in the Zero 2 W
4. Boot the Zero 2 W normally (let it fully start up)
5. Shut it down
6. Remove the OS SD card
7. Insert your empty SD card
8. Try the RPIBOOT connection process again

After this, RPIBOOT mode should work normally.

=== Problem: SD card not working

*Symptoms:* You have formatted the SD card, but the device still does not enter RPIBOOT mode.

*Solutions:*

* *Check the card is truly empty:* There shouldn't be any files or folders on the SD card.
* *Try a different SD card:* Some SD cards do not work well. Try a different card.
* *Reformat the SD card:* Use the official SD card formatter tool from the SD Association: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/

=== Problem: Provisioning Fails With Errors

*Symptoms:* The device connects but provisioning fails with errors.

*Solutions:*

* *Check your security mode:* Make sure you are NOT using `secure-boot` mode (it is not supported)
* *Use `fde-only` or `naked`:* These are the only supported modes for Zero 2 W
* *Check the logs:* See the main troubleshooting section in the README

== Summary

*Remember for Zero 2 W:*

* *NO secure boot support* - use `fde-only` or `naked` mode only
* *Empty SD card required* - need an empty FAT32 formatted SD card
* *Correct USB port* - use the "USB" port, not "PWR IN"
* *Cable quality matters* - use short, high-quality cables
* *USB port matters* - try USB 2 ports if USB 3 does not work
* *May need first boot* - boot with Raspberry Pi OS once if RPIBOOT fails

*One-time preparation*

1. No special setup needed

*Connection process:*

1. Insert empty SD card into Zero 2 W
2. Connect microUSB cable to "USB" port (not "PWR IN")
3. Device automatically enters RPIBOOT mode
4. Wait for provisioning to complete
