= Troubleshooting Zero 2 W devices

== Failure to enter RPIBOOT mode

If your Zero 2 W device does not enter RPIBOOT mode, try the following:

=== Change your USB cable for a shorter and higher quality cable

=== Change your USB port for a different port on your host machine (if you are using a USB 3 port, try a USB 2 port, for example)

=== Boot your Zero 2 W device with a recent version of Raspberry Pi OS (https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/issues/101#issuecomment-983641043)

== Triggering RPIBOOT mode

=== TODO: Add instructions here

== Using secure-boot provisioning style on Zero 2 W devices

=== Secure boot is not available on Zero 2 W devices. Provisioning with secure boot will produce undefined results - but absolutely nothing that will work as expected.
