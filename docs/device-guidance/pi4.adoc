_How to prepare Raspberry Pi 4 devices for provisioning_

== Overview

Raspberry Pi 4 differs from Raspberry Pi 5 in its boot mode entry method:

* Raspberry Pi 5 has a built-in power button
* Raspberry Pi 4 requires GPIO configuration

Each Raspberry Pi 4 device requires one-time GPIO configuration before it can be provisioned.

This configuration is permanent and stored in the device EEPROM.

== Step-by-Step Guide

=== Part 1: One-Time GPIO Configuration

Before provisioning, configure the device to use GPIO pin 8 for RPIBOOT mode.

*Requirements:*

* Raspberry Pi 4 device
* SD card with Raspberry Pi OS
* `recovery.bin` tool

*Procedure:*

1. Follow the official instructions at: +
https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/tree/master/secure-boot-recovery#step-2---select-the-nrpiboot-gpio

2. Use the `recovery.bin` tool to configure GPIO 8 as the RPIBOOT pin

3. Verify the configuration (see verification procedure below)

This configuration persists permanently in the device EEPROM and does not need to be repeated.

*Recommended GPIO Pin:* GPIO 8

=== Part 2: Verifying GPIO Configuration

After GPIO configuration, verify the settings were applied correctly.

*Verification procedure:*

1. Boot the Raspberry Pi 4 normally with an SD card containing Raspberry Pi OS

2. Open a terminal and execute:
+
----
sudo rpi-eeprom-config
----

3. Verify the output contains:
+
----
WAKE_ON_GPIO=1
GPIO_EXPANDER_CFG=0x00000008
----

If these lines are present, the configuration is correct and the device is ready for provisioning.

If these lines are not present, repeat the recovery.bin configuration procedure.

=== Part 3: Provisioning Connection Procedure

After GPIO 8 configuration is complete, the device can be provisioned.

*Required materials:*

* One jumper wire
* One USB-A to USB-C cable

*Connection procedure:*

1. Connect *GPIO 8* to *GND* (ground) on the Raspberry Pi 4 using the jumper wire
+
This activates RPIBOOT mode.

2. While maintaining the GPIO 8 to GND connection, connect the USB cable from your provisioning computer to the Raspberry Pi 4

3. Maintain the jumper wire connection throughout the entire provisioning process

4. Provisioning will begin automatically

*Note:* Unlike Raspberry Pi 5, no disconnection and reconnection is required. The device will complete all provisioning phases while the jumper remains in place.

=== Determining Completion

Monitor the device LEDs during provisioning:

* *Both LEDs off* = Provisioning is complete
* The jumper wire can now be removed
* The USB cable can be disconnected
* The device is ready for deployment

== Important Points To Remember

|===
|Point |Explanation

|*One-time setup*
|The GPIO configuration only needs to be done once per device. It is permanent.

|*GPIO 8 recommended*
|Use GPIO 8 for consistency. Other GPIO pins can work but GPIO 8 is the standard.

|*Keep jumper connected*
|Do not remove the jumper wire during provisioning. Leave it connected until both LEDs are off.

|*No re-connection needed*
|Unlike Raspberry Pi 5, you do not need to unplug and re-plug the device during provisioning.

|*Good cables matter*
|Use a high-quality USB cable. Poor cables cause connection problems.

== Troubleshooting Raspberry Pi 4

=== Problem: GPIO Configuration Did Not Work

*Symptoms:* When you run `sudo rpi-eeprom-config`, you do not see the GPIO settings.

*Solutions:*

* Follow the official recovery.bin instructions carefully: +
https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/tree/master/secure-boot-recovery#step-2---select-the-nrpiboot-gpio
* Make sure you used the correct recovery.bin file for your device
* Try the configuration process again
* Boot the device and verify again with `sudo rpi-eeprom-config`

*Advanced check:*

You can also extract and inspect the full EEPROM:

----
sudo rpi-eeprom-config --out /tmp/current-eeprom.bin
rpi-eeprom-config /tmp/current-eeprom.bin
----

=== Problem: Device Not Entering RPIBOOT Mode

*Symptoms:* You connect GPIO 8 to ground and plug in the USB cable, but nothing happens.

*Solutions:*

* *Check GPIO configuration first:* Use the verification steps above to confirm GPIO 8 was configured correctly
* *Check the physical connection:* Make sure the jumper wire connects GPIO 8 to a ground (GND) pin
* *Try a different USB cable:* Use a shorter, high-quality cable
* *Try a different USB port:* Some USB ports provide better power
* *Check your provisioning computer:* Make sure it has enough power
* *Try a different GPIO:* If GPIO 8 is not working, you can configure a different GPIO pin (but GPIO 8 is recommended)

=== Problem: Provisioning Stops or Hangs

*Symptoms:* The device starts provisioning but does not finish.

*Solutions:*

* *Keep the jumper wire connected:* Do not remove the GPIO 8 to ground connection during provisioning
* *Check the logs:* See the main troubleshooting section in the README
* *Verify the device was recognized:* Check that the provisioning system detected the device
* *Try again:* Disconnect everything, reconnect the jumper wire securely, and try again

== Summary

*Before first use:*

* Configure GPIO 8 using recovery.bin (once per device, permanent)
* Verify with `sudo rpi-eeprom-config`

*For each provisioning:*

* Connect GPIO 8 to GND with jumper wire
* Keep jumper wire connected
* Plug in USB cable
* Wait for both LEDs to turn off
* Remove jumper wire and disconnect

*Remember:*

* No disconnection/reconnection needed (unlike Pi 5)
* Use good quality USB cables
* Keep jumper wire in place until complete
